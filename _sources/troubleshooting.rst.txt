Troubleshooting
---------------

1. 
If you encounter errors when running dvas, first ensure that all the 
:ref:`required packages <installation:Requirements>` are up-to-date, then try again.

2. 
Check if this is one of the known open |issues|. You can also check the fixed issues
`here <https://github.com/MeteoSwiss-MDA/dvas/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+>`_.
  
3. 
If you still can't figure out what's wrong, please `submit a new issue on the Github repository of 
the project <https://github.com/MeteoSwiss-MDA/dvas/issues>`_. Provide as much detail as possible 
(dvas version, error message, minimal example, operating system, Python version, etc ...).
