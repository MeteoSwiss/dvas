Running dvas
============

This page is very much a WIP. Feel free to add/restructure this as you see fit. 



Naming conventions
------------------

The following applies throughout dvas:

   * any radiosonde profile ought to be associated to a specific **site**, **event**, **rig**, and
     **serial number** which respectively encode the spatial, temporal, and (possibly simultaneous, possibly multi-payload) launch  configurations. For GDPs, dvas also makes use of the version of the associated **GDP model**.
   * the **site**, **event**, and **rig** ought to be provided to dvas via `tags` in the metadata associated to a given profile.
