    ''' Computes the correlation coefficient(s) for specific uncertainty types between GDP
    measurements.

    The correlations are as follows:

    - sigmar (uncorrelated errors): no correlation between distinct measurements.
    - sigmas (spatial-correlated errors): full correlation between measurements acquired during the
      same event at the same site, irrespective of the altitude or radiosonde model.
    - sigmat (temporal-correlated errors): full correlation between measurements acquired at
      distinct sites during distinct events, with distinct radiosondes models.

    Args:
        i (numpy.ndarray of int or float): time step or altitude of measurement 1.
        j (numpy.ndarray of int or float): time step or altitude of measurement 2.
        uc_type (str): uncertainty type. Must be one of ['sigmar', 'sigmas', 'sigmat'].
        sn_i (numpy.ndarray of int or str, optional): serial number of RS from measurement 1.
        sn_j (numpy.ndarray of int or str, optional): seriel number of RS from measurement 2.
        rig_i (numpy.ndarray of int or str, optional): rig id of measurement 1.
        rig_j (numpy.ndarray of int or str, optional): rig id of measurement 2.
        event_i (numpy.ndarray of int or str, optional): event id of measurement 1.
        event_j (numpy.ndarray of int or str, optional): event id of measurement 2.
        site_i (numpy.ndarray of int or str, optional): site id of measurement 1.
        site_j (numpy.ndarray of int or str, optional): site id of measurement 2.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray of float: the correlation coefficient(s).

    Note:
        This function returns the pair-wise correlation coefficients, and
        **not** the full correlation matrix (i.e. `len(corcoef_gdps(i, j, uc_type))ÃŸ == len(i)`).

    Todo:
        - Consider refactoring the input using `collections.namedtuple` ?
        - Add reference to GRUAN docs in this docstring.
